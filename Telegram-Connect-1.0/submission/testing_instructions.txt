----------------------------------------------
This skill enables you to send and listen to messages with the Telegram Messenger (https://telegram.org/).
After the authorization process (see description) the user is "logged in" with the account that is used on his phone.

The offical Telegram API is used (https://core.telegram.org/#telegram-api). However, the API is very complex to understand. This is the reason why Telethon (https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) is used. This library allows to interact with the Telegram API on a more abstract level.

The receiver of the message will see the phone number that was used during the authorization process.
